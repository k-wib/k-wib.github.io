I am a first year PhD student in Statistics at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. My research interests broadly lie in the areas of theoretical machine learning and high-dimensional statistics. I graduated from National University of Singapore (2019) with a BS (Honours) in Applied Mathematics and Statistics, and Columbia University (2020) with an MS in Data Science. Before enrolling in the PhD program, I had the opportunity to work at several companies, including Walmart and Traveloka.

I am very passionate about teaching, and I always strive to get better at communicating difficult concepts to my students. Besides teaching, I enjoy watching badminton matches, listening to Korean indie music, and admiring different countries' electricity poles and bollards in Geoguessr.
